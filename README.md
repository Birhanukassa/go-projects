# Kubernetes Development Environment

> **Kubernetes development setup with automated syncing, branch protection, and safe experimentation capabilities.**

[![Sync Status](https://github.com/Birhanukassa/go-projects/actions/workflows/auto-sync.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Birhanukassa/go-projects/actions/workflows/auto-sync.yml)


##  Overview

This repository contains a complete development environment for contributing to Kubernetes, featuring:

- **Dual Worktrees** - Separate environments for production contributions and safe experimentation
- **Automated Syncing** - GitHub Actions + local cron jobs keep everything current with upstream
- **Experiment Protection** - Pause system prevents work from being overwritten during development
- **Professional Workflow** - Branch protection and PR requirements showcase best practices
- **Complete Toolchain** - 21 development tools for Kubernetes contribution

##  Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Birhanukassa/kubernetes.git go-projects
cd go-projects

# Enable automation
./setup-daily-sync.sh

# Verify installation
./check-dev-tools.sh

# Start developing
cd kubernetes          # For serious contributions
cd learning           # For experiments and learning
```

##  Sync Management

### Automatic Syncing
- **GitHub Actions**: Daily sync at 3 AM UTC
- **Local Cron**: Hourly sync + terminal startup check
- **Manual**: `./daily-sync-check.sh`

### Experiment Control
```bash
./pause-experiments.sh    # Pause test-experiments sync
./resume-experiments.sh   # Resume test-experiments sync
```

##  Security Features

- **Branch Protection**: All branches require PR workflow
- **Owner Bypass**: Emergency access for repository owner
- **Force Push Prevention**: Protects against accidental history rewriting
- **Automated Validation**: Continuous sync monitoring

##  Structure

```
go-projects/
├── kubernetes/          # Production Kubernetes development
├── learning/           # Safe experimentation environment  
├── bin/               # Development tools (kubectl, golangci-lint, etc.)
├── scripts/           # Automation and utility scripts
└── docs/             # Environment documentation
```

##  Learning Path

1. **Explore** - Use `learning/` for safe experimentation
2. **Learn** - Follow Kubernetes development patterns
3. **Contribute** - Create features in `kubernetes/` 
4. **Showcase** - Professional workflow visible to employers

##  Monitoring

- **Sync Status**: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Birhanukassa/kubernetes/actions)
- **Tool Health**: `./check-dev-tools.sh`
- **Environment Status**: `./daily-sync-check.sh`

##  Development Workflow

### Professional Contribution Process
See [Branching & PR Workflow Guide](docs/BRANCHING_WORKFLOW.md) for complete workflow diagram, exact git commands, and professional PR checklist.

**Quick Overview:**
1. **Experiment safely** in `learning/` - break things, try approaches
2. **Cherry-pick solutions** to clean `kubernetes/` branch
3. **Polish and test** - professional commit messages and quality checks
4. **Submit clean PR** - reviewers see only relevant, tested changes

### Safe Experimentation
```bash
cd learning
./pause-experiments.sh
git checkout -b learn-api-internals
# Experiment freely without sync interference
./resume-experiments.sh  # When finished
```
